## Introduction

"Plants vs Zombies" (PvZ) is one of the most iconic mobile games of all time, known for its delightful mix of strategy, tower defense, and quirky characters.

The game’s simple yet addictive mechanics, where players must plant various types of plants to defend their gardens from waves of approaching zombies, have made it a favorite for both casual and hardcore gamers.

As the franchise evolved, various spin-off titles and mods have emerged, one of the most notable being "PvZ Fusion."
